### Hi, stranger! 😄

My name is Douglas and I'm a Computer Engineering Student and a Software Engineer from Brazil. I've started to code basically because I'm passionate about the feeling of building something from scratch. It's a indescribable sensation.

I'm currently developing projects using the languages Python and Javascript. For the most part I use Django as my main tool for Backend Development and React.js for Frontend.

In my spare time I appreciate a good reading and listen to a good song. 😄
