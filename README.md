### Hi there 😄

My name is Douglas Brandão from Brazil. I've been studying Computer Engineering since 2015 and I'm currently working with Django Framework and diving into React Ecosystem. 

Besides that, I like to read books :book:, listen to a good music :headphones: and play a CSGO :video_game: in my free time.

You can find me on my social medias
